Welcome to the quick start guide for the Coronavirus Drug Discovery Journey. 

## Objective:  
Find a candidate drug (ligand) with a high binding affinity with the 2019-COVID main protease. A few studies have shown that HIV antivirals offer promising results, but this is still an open field of discovery. Use machine learning to identify a potential candidate, then use docking software to get the binding affinity between it and the main protease. Write a report that describes your process and results in detail in the form of a jupyter notebook. Finding a new drug or validating an existing drug are both suitable approaches, we will be donating samples of the winning compound to the Wuhan Institute of Virology for further analysis.
